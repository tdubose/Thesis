\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction

\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivation (cornea, phenotype control, increase backscatter)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Corneal disease big, bad (get stats)

\item Want to grow artifical corneas

\item Use patient's own cells to prevent immunorejection

\item Corneal made of collagen; electrospun collagen bad

\item Use corneal cells to reenact dev. bio; relay collagen in nice transparent form

\item Can't see cells inside collagen--collagen scatters too highly

\item Want to see cells by increasing their scattering intensity far past that of the collagen

\item Do that by immunospecifically binding gold to cells

\item Specifically, use the alpha5-beta1-integrin surface protein in the myofibroblast (wound healing) phenotype, as most of the transplanted cells will in that phenotype

\item a5b1-integrin is the attachment point for intercellular matrix fibronectins, connects to intracellular actin filaments

\end{enumerate}

\item What kind of gold do we use? (Coates thesis)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solid gold sphere (as opposed to gold shell on different core)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gives best scattering to absorption cross sectional coefficients

\item Also avoids a specific plasmon resonance changing the spectral scattering profile, resulting in poor coherence gating.

\end{enumerate}

\item 90 nm diameter

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mediates between increased scattering and decreased time in solution (give number and graph)

\item Also keeps particles small enough to be absorbed through cell membranes

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\item Failure of van der waals, move to PEG (Rob)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Up to Spring 2009, antibodies (AP326F) were simply mixed with Au nanoparticles, but this produced unsatisfactory specificity

\item Rob found Jen West's paper on immunolabeling with PEG; we adapted and began to use it (FA09--SP10)

\end{enumerate}

\item Lack of specificity or stability; Ellis\slash Hoidn for pH and 5 kDa; NHS

\begin{enumerate}
\item Unfortunately, the PEGylated spheres produced similarly dismal results. Therefore, over \begin{summer 2010}
	
\end{summer 2010}, Perry Ellis and Oliver Hoidn investigated the system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item pH and salt needed to be maintained

\item our PEG-SH was too small to properly protect the gold, and especially necessary given the salts

\item concerns about NHS

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\item Creation of current protocol

\begin{enumerate}
\item 5 kDa PEG-SH titration curve to find plateau at 50k PS\slash Au

\item 5 kDa PEG-SH protection studies: monolayer (50k PS\slash Au) gives perfectly stable particles

\item Modification of Ellis\slash Hoidn protocol to include 5 kDa PEG-SH

\item Volume control (Alanna's pipette measurements) --- everything over 5 ÂµL

\item Reference to Appendix containing protocol

\end{enumerate}

\item DLS results with protocol

\begin{enumerate}
\item AP124F results: proper increase with Ab, small increase from PS then hold steady

\item AP124, MAB1999 results: note that they are puzzling; perhaps future work will bring clarity?

\item In vitro binding studies go here, if we get to them?

\end{enumerate}

\item Monolayer Labeling Study

\item 3D culture study

\end{enumerate}
