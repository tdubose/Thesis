1. Create or obtain phosphate buffered Milli-Q (PBM-Q), at least 500 mL.
	2. Based on the work of Ellis and Hoidn [](#hoidnellis), the salt concentration of the solution should be 10 mM with a pH of 7.6.
	3. To make 500 mL PBM-Q, combine 130 mg \\(\mathrm{NaH_2PO_4\cdot H_2O}\\), 1090 mg \\(\mathrm{Na_2HPO_4\cdot7H_2O}\\), and 500 mL Milli-Q in a 500 mL sealable bottle. The Milli-Q should be measured out in a graduated cylinder.
4. Next, bind the OPSS-PEG-NHS (OPN) to the antibody (Ab). We want approximately a 2:1 ratio of OPN:Ab. The number concentration of the Ab is \\[\frac{8.92\times10^{15}\#\mathrm{Ab}}{mL}=\left(2\mathrm{\frac{mg}{mL}}\right)\left(\frac{6.02\times10^{23}\,\#\mathrm{Ab}}{135 kg}\right).\\]
	Measuring a quantity less than 1 mg of OPN is quite difficult, and we want to use a minimum pipette volume of 5 \\(\mu\\)L. Therefore, we will use 6 mg of OPN in 200 mL of PBM-Q. This gives a solution with 
\\[\frac{8.6\times10^{15}\#\mathrm{OPN}}{mL}=\left(6/200\mathrm{\frac{mg}{mL}}\right)\left(\frac{6.02\times10^{23}\,\#\mathrm{Ab}}{2.1 kg}\right).\\]
Then, we combine 62.5 \\(\mu\\)L PBM-Q, 12.5 \\(\mu\\)L Ab, and 25 \\(\mu\\)L OPN+PBM-Q solution. Since the concentration of the Ab and OPN are approximately the same, and the volume used of the OPN+PBM-Q solution is double that of the Ab, there should be approximately a 2:1 OPN:Ab ratio. The actual procedure should be as follows:
	5. Fill insulated container with ice.
	6. In a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, combine 62.5 \\(\mu\\)L PBM-Q and 12.5 \\(\mu\\)L Ab. Put tube in ice.
	8. Measure out 200 mL PBM-Q and put in a sealable 250 mL bottle.
	9. Measure out 6 mg OPN and add it to the 200 mL PBM-Q.
	10. Quickly add 25 \\(\mu\\)L OPN+PBM-Q solution to the centrifuge tube, to minimize hydrolysis of the NHS ester.
	11. Wait 24 hours for complete binding.
12. Next, bind the OPAb to the Au nanospheres. We want 2000 OPAb/Au, and we want 500 mL of labeled spheres. The OPAb concentration is \\(1.1\times10^{15} \mathrm{\frac{\#OPAb}{mL}}\\); therefore, we need 
\\[\left(500 \mu\mathrm{L} Au\right)\left(5\times10^9\mathrm{\frac{Au}{mL}}\right)\left(2000\mathrm{\frac{OPAb}{Au}}\right)/\left(1.1\times10^{15} \mathrm{\frac{\#OPAb}{mL}}\right)=4.5\mu\mathrm{L\ OPAb}.\\] The procedure for this step is:
	1. pH-correct/buffer Au solution:
		2. Centrifuge 500 \\(\mu\\)L Au at 4200 RPM with soft brake for 10 minutes in a 5417C centrifuge.
		3. Remove 2/3 of the supernatant (333 \\(\mu\\)L) and replace with PBM-Q, making sure to resuspend the Au solution very well.
	4. Add 4.5 \\(\mu\\)L OPAb solution made the previous day to the Au solution.
	5. Immediately DLS 50 \\(\mu\\)L of the OPAb-Au solution.
	6. Wait 24 hours for OPAb-Au reaction to complete; again, DLS 50 \\(\mu\\)L.
7. The final step of nanoparticle assembly is to add 5 kDa PEG-SH to the OPAb-Au. We want 10000 PEG-SH/Au for the 400 mL of remaining OPAb-Au solution.
	8. First, make a PEG-SH+PBM-Q solution. 300 mL PBM-Q and 10 mg 5 kDa PEG-SH gives \\[\frac{4\times10^{15}\#\mathrm{PS}}{mL}=\left(10/300\mathrm{\frac{mg}{mL}}\right)\left(\frac{6.02\times10^{23}\,\#\mathrm{Ab}}{5 kg}\right).\\]
	9. To get 10,000 PS/Au, we add
	\\[\left(400 \mu\mathrm{L} OPAb-Au\right)\left(5\times10^9\mathrm{\frac{OPAb-Au}{mL}}\right)\left(10000\mathrm{\frac{OPAb}{Au}}\right)/\left(4\times10^{15} \mathrm{\frac{\#PS}{mL}}\right)=5\mu\mathrm{L\ PS/}\\]
	to the 400 \\(\mu\\)L OPAb-solution.
	10. DLS 50 \\(\mu\\)L OPAb-Au-PS immediately.
	11. Wait 24 hours; DLS 50 \\(\mu\\)L OPAb-Au-PS.
12. A final, optional step is to check the protection of the fully labeled and protected nanospheres. To do this, obtain a new centrifuge tube and put at least equal volumes (at least 50 \\(\mu\\)L) of both OPAb-Au-PS solution and commercial PBS solution. DLS 50 \\(\mu\\)L. Radius should be stable if the spheres are protected.
